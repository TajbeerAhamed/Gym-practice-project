                <p>Developing a consistent fitness routine and participating in 60 minutes of physical activity every
                    day will
                    improve both your physical and emotional health. There are many ways to be physically active, from
                    dancing and yoga to swimming and lifting weights—how you want to move is up to you! Take the time
                    to improve your health and fitness now—and your body will thank you later!</p>

                <p>Make sure you have
                    enough space around you by extending
                    your arms away from the center of your
                    body. Try jumping your body higher with
                    each jump. Using bigger movements will
                    allow the body to warm up more quickly</p>

                <p>The key to sticking to your fitness plan is to create a plan that you will enjoy. Figuring out your
                    why is just as important as deciding what exercises you
                    will
                    fit into your plan. Therefore, before you create your fitness plan, take some time to reflect on
                    your
                    attitude about health and fitness and your thoughts about living a physically active lifestyle. Use
                    the
                    space below to share your thoughts about starting your fitness journey.</p>
